Hello, I am (was) DownCloud. This is the end of this account. Things have changed and I learnt some new things about how to do things. I don't think it is the right thing to continue. I will probably contonue developing, being active online, do smaller contributions, etc., but with a new idendity. This account's purpose will be to be an offsite backup. Everything has to come to an end, with this (and other) accounts not being excluded. 

Have a great day.
Sincerely, a gone DownCloud...
